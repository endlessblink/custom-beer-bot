# Error Handling Strategy  
  
## Overview  
  
Proper error handling is crucial for ensuring application stability and providing a good user experience.  
This document outlines the standardized approach to error handling in the WhatsApp Bot.  
  
## Error Classification  
  
Errors are classified into the following categories:  
  
1. **API Errors**: Issues with external services (Green API, OpenAI)  
2. **Database Errors**: Problems with database connections or queries  
3. **Validation Errors**: Invalid input data or configuration  
4. **Runtime Errors**: Unexpected errors during execution  
5. **Environment Errors**: Issues with the system environment or dependencies 
  
## Error Handling Principles  
  
1. **Fail Gracefully**: The application should never crash completely due to an error  
2. **Provide Context**: Log detailed information about the error, including stack traces  
3. **User Friendly Messages**: Display helpful error messages to the user without technical details  
4. **Retry When Appropriate**: Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors  
5. **Default Values**: Provide sensible defaults when data cannot be retrieved  
  
## Implementation Pattern  
  
Use the following pattern for error handling:  
  
```python  
try:  
    # Operation that might fail  
    result = potentially_failing_operation()  
except SpecificException as e:  
    # Log detailed error for developers  
    logger.error(f"Specific error occurred: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)  
    # Handle the error appropriately  
    # Provide user-friendly message  
    return handle_specific_error(e)  
except Exception as e:  
    # Log unexpected errors  
    logger.critical(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)  
    # Fall back to safe default  
    return safe_default_value  
finally:  
    # Clean up resources if needed  
    cleanup_resources()  
``` 
  
## Retry Mechanism  
  
For transient errors (network issues, rate limiting), implement exponential backoff retries:  
  
```python  
def operation_with_retry(operation, max_retries=3, initial_delay=1, backoff_factor=2):  
    """Execute an operation with retry logic using exponential backoff."""  
    retries = 0  
    delay = initial_delay  
ECHO is on.
